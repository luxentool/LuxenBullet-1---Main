Thank you for downloading LuxenBullet!

We constantly make updates, so first of all run "Update Check" before to start "LuxenBullet".

It is better to turn off antivirus before to start it, since they can flag LuxenBullet as a "malware". This is due to false-positive (https://support.avira.com/hc/en-us/articles/360002183358-What-is-a-false-positive-Avira-Antivirus-detection-).

That's all and don't use it to grab accounts without the permission of the "victim".
