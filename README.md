LuxenBullet 1 is a native modded and revised version of OpenBullet. 
It basically allows to perform requests towards a target webapp and offers a lot of tools to work with the results. This software can be used for **scraping** and **parsing data**, automated **pentesting** and much more.

# Features/Updates

- Stable and Native (no need to setup localhost ecc)
- Added PWA
- Lightweight, Lower Ram usage (<~43%)
- Minor Bugs Fixed (SEOA)
- Faster on performance*

*We took some test comparing OpenBullet 2 (main github original version) vs LuxenBullet.
Same proxies (Rotating Residential), same combolist (100k Email:Pass), same config (DAZN), same internet connection, same laptop, same processes opened (checking on Task Manager).
- OpenBullet2 needed 2 hours 38 minutes to complete the tasks 
- LuxenBullet needed 2 hours 09 minutes to complete the tasks

# Download and setup
**It is better to turn off antivirus before to start it, since they can flag LuxenBullet as a "malware". This is due to false-positive (https://support.avira.com/hc/en-us/articles/360002183358-What-is-a-false-positive-Avira-Antivirus-detection-)**
Download the release from this repo. We constantly make updates, so after download, run "Update Check" before to start "LuxenBullet".
